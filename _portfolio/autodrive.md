# AutoDrive II Challenge

The AutoDrive II Challenge is a GM and SAE sponsored event in which universities receive a stock Chevy EUV Bolt and make it autonomous over 5 years. This challenge began in 2021 and ends in June 2026. Scored challenges progressively get harder as each year passes with topics including base-level object detection, and spanning to non-gps-based localization in an area. Teams then meet in June of each year to compete at University of Michigan's test track, M-City.

__Timeline:__ August 2024 - Present

In year 4 of the AutoDrive II Challenge, teams are being put up to the task of navigating through an environment with intermittent gps signal drops. With this challenge in mind, I was assigned the task of building the new localization system from scratch for our team. Currently, I am working on making an adaption of KISS-ICP which is a simple ICP based localization system as a way to solve this challenge.
