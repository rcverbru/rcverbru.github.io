I'm a fourth year Robotics major at Michigan Tech where I focus on perception and mapping systems for autonomous vehicles. I've worked in various research labs over the past three years, starting off in [Dr. Tan Chen](https://chentan.github.io/)'s Robotic Locomotion and Applied Control (RoLAC), then moving to my current location in Dr. Jeremy Bos's Robust Autonomous Systems Lab (RASL).

## Research Interests

* Perception Systems for Autonomous Vehicles
* Mapping and Planning Systems for Autonomous Vehicles
* Wildlife Conservation using Automotive Grade Sensors
* LiDAR Object Detection in Adverse Weather Conditions
