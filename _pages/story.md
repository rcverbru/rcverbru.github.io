I'm a fourth year Robotics major at Michigan Tech where I focus on perception and mapping systems for autonomous vehicles. I've worked in various research labs over the past three years, starting off in [Dr. Tan Chen](https://chentan.github.io/)'s Robotic Locomotion and Applied Control (RoLAC), then moving to my current location in Dr. Jeremy Bos's Robust Autonomous Systems Lab (RASL).
