## Additional Projects

### AutoDrive Challenge II

The [AutoDrive II Challenge](https://www.autodrivechallenge.com/) is a GM and SAE sponsored event in which universities receive a stock Chevy EUV Bolt and make it autonomous over 5 years. This challenge began in 2021 and ends in June 2026. Scored challenges progressively get harder as each year passes with topics including base-level object detection, and spanning to non-gps-based localization in an area. Teams then meet in June of each year to compete at University of Michigan's test track, M-City.

__Roles:__ Michigan Tech AutoDrive Team Captain, Robotics Systems Enterprise Director, Enterprise Assistant Director, Outreach Coordinator, Lab manager, Team Lead

#### Personal Contributions:
- Computer vision through usage of a neural network and a camera
- Object detection and tracking through a lidar sensor
- Autonomous Vehicle simulation through for subsystem testing
- Implementation of feature level sensor fusion
- Creation of vehicle behavior management system
- Creation of mapping and path planning system using a standard planning algorithm
- Built LiDAR based localization system from scratch

#### Current AutoDrive Work:

- [Diving Rod](https://github.com/rcverbru/divining-rod) - A LiDAR Based Localization System\
In year 4 of the AutoDrive II Challenge, teams are being put up to the task of navigating through an environment with intermittent gps signal drops. With this challenge in mind, I was assigned the task of building the new localization system from scratch for our team. Currently, I am working on making an adaption of KISS-ICP which is a simple ICP based localization system as a way to solve this challenge.
