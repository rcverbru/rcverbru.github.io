## Additional Projects

### AutoDrive Challenge II

The AutoDrive II Challenge is a GM and SAE sponsored event in which universities receive a stock Chevy EUV Bolt and make it autonomous over 5 years. This challenge began in 2021 and ends in June 2026. Scored challenges progressively get harder as each year passes with topics including base-level object detection, and spanning to non-gps-based localization in an area. Teams then meet in June of each year to compete at the University of Michigan's test track, M-City.

__Roles:__ Michigan Tech AutoDrive Team Captain, Robotics Systems Enterprise Director, Enterprise Assistant Director, Outreach Coordinator, Lab manager, Team Lead

__Personal Contributions:__
- Computer vision through usage of a neural network and a camera
- Object detection and tracking through a lidar sensor
- Autonomous Vehicle simulation through for subsystem testing
- Implementation of feature level sensor fusion
- Creation of vehicle behavior management system
- Creation of mapping and path planning system using a standard planning algorithm
- Built LiDAR based localization system from scratch

__Major AutoDrive Contributions:__

- LiDAR Object Detection}
    - In my first year on the team, and in my first year working with this system, I worked on basic Euclidean Clustering and plane-ground filtering. Both of these implementations were done through use of PCL Libraries.
- Vehicle Navigation, Path Planning, and Behavioral Subsystems
    - In Year 3 of the AutoDrive II Challenge, I implemented a D* Lite path planner for basic vehicle navigation through GPS-defined map infrastructure. 
- LiDAR Based Localization System (See [github.com](https://github.com/rcverbru/divining-rod))
    - In year 4 of the AutoDrive II Challenge, teams were put to the task of navigating through an environment with intermittent GPS signal drops. With this challenge in mind, I was assigned the task of building the new localization system from scratch for our team. To do this, I worked on making an adaptation of [KISS-ICP](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/vizzo2023ral.pdf), which is a simple ICP based localization system, as a way to solve this challenge. The aim was to make a lightweight localization system so that we can successfully detect where we are within our environment and navigate to our end-goal location safely.
