Hello all, I'm Ryan Verbrugge and I'm a fourth year Robotics major at Michigan Tech where I focus on perception and mapping systems for autonomous vehicles. Most of my work has been on GM and SAE's AutoDrive Challenge II but have done work within the research space on similar projects.

## Projects and Research
